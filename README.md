# Java-Tank-Game-Demo
My personal take on the CSA tank game project (allegedly).
I don't know how to title commits. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

HEALTH - Base tank health, not much to say here :)  
DEFENSE - Percentage of incoming attack negated (E.g. Beserker's 15% base defense would negate 1.5 damage from a base 10 damage attack, leading to only a loss of 8.5 health instead of 10)  
DMGMODIFIER - Base damage boost from base attack (0-10 HP, may change this to individualize to tanks, idk) (E.g. Beserker's 5 dmgmodifier allows its attacks to be at a range of 5-15 damage instead of 0-10)  
ARMORUP - Min/Max Range for Defense gained when tank takes a turn to armorup  
ARMORUP - Min/Max Range for Attack gained when tank takes a turn to attackup  

BERS: 45 HEALTH 15 DEFENSE 5 DMGMODIFIER 5-10 ARMORUP 7-12 ATTACKUP  
TANKY: 80 HEALTH 30 DEFENSE 0 DMGMODIFIER 7-12 ARMORUP 3-5 ATTACKUP  
GLASS: 35 HEALTH 5 DEFENSE 20 DMGMODIFIER 5-10 ARMORUP 10-20 ATTACKUP  
RAND: 40-60 HEALTH 5-12 DEFENSE 0-5 DMGMODIFIER ARU MIN 2-5 ARU MAX 6-9 ATU MIN 3-7 ATU MAX 8-12 (THIS TANK IS BROKEN)
